# GiantessWorld Archiver

shitty script that downloads GiantessWorld stories for archival purposes.

### Features

- downloads each story to a separate folder of html files
- the story links in the files actually work. Or some of them, anyway
- saves space by discarding unnecessary html like the sidebar and header
- downloads a ton really fast because the site doesn't do any rate limiting???

### How to use

1. have ruby 3.4 or higher
2. `bundle install`
3. run `run.rb` with an option

### Options

### `ruby run.rb s`

downloads all stories to `./scrape/stories`

- downloads all story IDs up to 17000, including reviews
- skips deleted or nonexistent stories
- oh no, oh my gosh, are there more than 1700 story IDs now???? Sorry, it's hard-coded, change the code yourself you big dummy

### `ruby run.rb u`

downloads author bios and story reviews to `./scrape/users`

- must be run AFTER you run `ruby run.rb s`
- only downloads bios for users who either (a) left a review, or (b) wrote a story. It uses the data you downloaded in `ruby run.rb s` to determine who those are. In other words, it does *not* scrape the site to find its list of users to scrape.

### `ruby run.rb o`

downloads the old story archive to `./scrape/old_stories`

- many of the links there are broken, and this script attempts to fix the links and download the stories. It is able to find *most* of them. Some I just couldn't figure out.

I will not be offering any kind of support or maintenance for this code - unless you ask *really* nicely, or if you are a cute girl. Then I will happily bend over backwards and discard all of my dignity for you. I will even send you a sub-$10 item from Amazon. (Okay, no I won't. But I reserve the right to imagine doing so.)

the archive I made when I originally wrote this script is available from a link in the GiantessWorld discord. Can you find it???
